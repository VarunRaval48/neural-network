# neural-network
Build various neural network models writing all the layers, gradients of weights from scratch.

Main aim is to learn Tensorflow and Convolutional Neural Networks by implementing forward and backward propagation in CNN using Tensorflow from scratch.

I will implement various layers of CNN and then check the effects of the presence or absence of various layers over the accuracy on different datasets.

Datasets I am planning to use are NORB, CALTECH 101, MNIST.

## Work Done

Normal Neural Network is ready. You can add as many fully connected layers as required. I have also implemented output layer with logistic loss.

For example see the *classify_iris.py* file.
